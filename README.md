Asteroids -- Carleton COMP 1406 Assignment 4 (2009)

Ship is invincible for a period of time after being destroyed.
Movement is clearly bad.

Game plays normally, only main addition is that pressing B will allow you to use a force field bomb thing
but is limited to only 3 throughout the whole game.	

You can run the .jar in the github folder. If you want to hear sounds, include the sound files in the 
same directory as the .jar
